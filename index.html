    <h4>Akan-Name-Gnerator Background.</h4>
    <p>An Akan name generator is a tool that assigns traditional Akan names
      based on the day of the week someone was born.The Akan people are an
      ethinic group from Ghana and Cote dIvoire in West Africa.In Akan culture,
      children are traditionaly given a "day name"corresponding to the day of the 
      week they were born.These names also iindicate the child's gender.Eg if a male 
      child was born on a Sunday he would be called Kwasi.
